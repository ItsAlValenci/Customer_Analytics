# Customer Analytics Project

This repository contains a comprehensive customer analytics project that demonstrates advanced segmentation techniques, behavioral analysis, and predictive modeling using retail transaction data. The project focuses on identifying distinct customer segments and predicting purchase behavior to optimize marketing strategies and business decisions.

## Project Overview

The Customer Analytics project is divided into three main components, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning:

### 1. Customer Segmentation
In this component, we perform unsupervised learning to identify distinct customer groups based on demographic and behavioral characteristics. Key activities include:

- Data preprocessing and standardization
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- K-Means clustering to identify customer segments
- Hierarchical clustering for validation
- Statistical analysis of segment characteristics

### 2. Customer Positioning and Analysis
This component focuses on understanding the unique characteristics and behaviors of each customer segment. Key activities include:

- Demographic profiling across age, income, education, and lifestyle factors
- Purchase behavior analysis including frequency and brand preferences
- Revenue contribution assessment by segment
- Brand choice analysis and market positioning insights
- Visualization of segment differences and business implications

### 3. Purchase Prediction Modeling
In this component, we build supervised learning models to predict customer purchase behavior. Key activities include:

- Feature engineering incorporating price sensitivity and promotional effects
- Logistic regression for purchase probability prediction
- Linear regression for quantity forecasting
- Model evaluation and performance assessment
- Business recommendations based on predictive insights

## Dataset

The project uses two main datasets:

**Segmentation Data**: Customer demographic information including:
- Customer demographics (sex, marital status, age, education)
- Economic factors (income, occupation)
- Geographic information (settlement size)

**Purchase Data**: Transaction history containing:
- Purchase incidence and brand choice
- Quantity and pricing information
- Promotional activity data
- Previous purchase behavior
- Customer demographic overlay

## Tools and Technologies

The project utilizes various data science tools and technologies:

- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for reproducible analysis
- Pickle for model serialization and deployment

## Business Applications

This analysis enables several strategic business applications:

- Targeted marketing campaigns based on segment characteristics
- Optimized pricing strategies for different customer groups
- Inventory management and demand forecasting by segment
- Customer lifetime value prediction and optimization
- Product development prioritization based on segment preferences
